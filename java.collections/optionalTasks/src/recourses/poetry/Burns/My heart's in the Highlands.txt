My heart’s in the Highlands wherever I go.
A-chasing the wild deer, and following the roe,
My heart’s in the Highlands, a-chasing the deer;
My heart’s in the Highlands, my heart is not here;

Farewell to the torrents and loud-pouring floods:
Farewell to the forests and wild-hanging woods;
Farewell to the straths and green valleys below;
Farewell to the mountains high cover’d with snow;

The hills of the Highlands for ever I love.
Wherever I wander, wherever I rove,
The birth-place of valour, the country of worth;
Farewell to the Highlands, farewell to the North,

My heart’s in the Highlands wherever I go.
A-chasing the wild deer, and following the roe,
My heart’s in the Highlands, a-chasing the deer;
My heart’s in the Highlands, my heart is not here;
